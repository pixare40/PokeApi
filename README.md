# PokeApi

Pokemon API for getting pokemon data from the pokeapi endpoint.

## Organisation

The project is is organised into 5 projects:

* PokeApi - The main project
* PokeApi.Infrastructure - project housing infrastructure code such as HttpClientWrapper
* PokeApi.Models - housing common models
* PokeApi.PokemonManagement - Domain library housing specific code for pokemon management
* PokeApi.Tests - the test project

## Deploy and Run

The application is docker ready with Orchestration support. The docker file is located in the PokeApi folder as well as a docker compose yml file.

### Steps

* Download Docker Desktop at <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>
* To deploy and run, cd into the root folder and run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

You can now navigate to the application at
<http://localhost:8080/pokemon>

## Things I could have done differently in production level situation:

* At present I have attempted to cache results using the built in inMemoryCache due to the rate limits for the translations API. In production a more robust solution would be using an off app solution like redis.
* DOCUMENTATION - I have not really documented this API at all. A simple thing would be displaying the swagger pages in development but that would not be sufficiently conclusive.
* I tried not to over engineer the dynamic nature of the translators because I kept thinking of how I could possibly add more translators which are completely different in future but I wanted it still simple enough for the scope of the project.
* The reasoning behind having multiple class libraries abstracted by interfaces is to mimic having separate teams working across multiple domains instead providing consumable libraries for the product.
* I would split the tests from one project to multiple projects which would be the case if there were different domain teams.
* LOGGING & TELEMETRY - in this current implementation I haven't included any logging even at console level. But in production I would engineer this to a Splunk instance for example. Metrics of things like execution timings and hit rates would be important for factors such as if we had subscription to the translation API etc. We can do Telemetry using .NET Application Insights.
* I have tried to isolate configurable sections for the app into the appsettings files as good practice and we can adjust these variables as part of the CI/CD pipeline if needed.
* I might have chosen weird names for some of the files ðŸ˜‰
